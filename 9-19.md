Class Presentation = time where classmates = consultants. If they say "what about this aspect?", its not about defending your position (how you have already implemented it), but to take notes and to implement their ideas into your final product.

## Grid Chart

> Instead of having a beer and say "here's how we can do it", it's a way to be systematic.

Grid Chart isn't end all be all. Other than Quality of Life, Use of Power, Risks and Reliability, Property Rights..., you will add other columns as issues arise. (But don't overdo it, since you can go on for infinity: Scoping is useful in these situations.)

Nations/Globals = could be UN policies. (e.g. how do European privacy systems differ from U.S. systems? perceptions?)
